# Project Website

This repository jekyll-ized the source code for the [MetaPrompting website](https://suzgunmirac.github.io/MetaPrompting).
You only need to change the content of [index.md](/index.md). 
It's possible to only write in markdown, but you can also use HTML to achieve more fancy effects.
